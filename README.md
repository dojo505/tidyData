# tidyData
course project for tidy data assignment

0. Introduction
This script, run_analysis.R, reads in accelerometer data and produces
a tidy data set. The raw input data is located in the train and test
directories with additional files in this directory describing the 
variables. 

run_analysis.R needs several files to run and will produce output
in the tidy_output directory. 

(note: due to file size issues I have not uploaded the raw data to GitHub)

2. Description of files added
- README.md
- codebook.txt: an updated version of the features_info.txt file,
     lists the activities and the measurements kept
- run_analysis.R: script which produces the output tidy data
- tidy_output/merged_data.txt: binded data sets, only mean and std_dev
- tidy_output/tidy_data.txt: dataset with average of each variable per subject/activity

3. Original files

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

3. Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
